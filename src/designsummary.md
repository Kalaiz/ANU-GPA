- Calculate all possible permutations of HDs,Ds,CRs,Ps needed for acquiring a specified  overall GPA.
- Inbuilt GPA calc

#### Implementation
- Using backtracking permutation algorithm OR heap's algorithm to obtain the possible permutation.
- Building the GPA calc is going to be straightforward:the calc will follow the ANU GPA system.
